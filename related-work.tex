\subsection{Hydrodynanamics of the region} 

Early work by University of British Columbia made surveys in the 1970s \cite{ppickard71}.

\subsection{Environmental/aquaculture}

\citep{niklitschek13}

\subsection*{Tidal energy in inlets}

Work has been done to study tidal energy potential of Admiralty Inlet, located in the Puget Sound in Washington state, USA. The inlet has currents up to (I think) 3 m/s on spring tides. Marine energy related work: \citep{polagye13, kawasethyng10, thomson12, polagye09}. 

There is also extensive study of the area in terms of fjord dynamics, form drag, estuarine physics \citep[e.g.][]{warner13, geyer82}.


\subsection*{Oceanography of the Patagonian shelf, influence of Magellan inputs}
Productivity on the Patagonian shelf \citep{song16}. Numerical modeling on the Patagonian shelf is mostly based on the work of V. Combes \citep{combes14}. The Magellan plume \citep{palma12} which cites the work by Panella et al. 1991 as model inputs.

\subsection*{Prior measurements in the Strait of Magellen}
Measurements that have been made in the Magallanes... \citep{antezana99}
