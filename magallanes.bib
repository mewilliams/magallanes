  abstract = { Tidal energy resource characteristics are presented from a multi-year field study in northern Admiralty Inlet, Puget Sound, WA (USA). Measurements were conducted as part of a broader effort to characterize the physical and biological environment at this location ahead of a proposed tidal energy project. The resource is conceptually partitioned into deterministic, meteorological, and turbulent components. Metrics with implications for device performance are used to describe spatial variations in the tidal resource. The performance differences between passive and fixed yaw turbines are evaluated at these locations. Results show operationally significant variations in the tidal resource over length scales less than 100 m, likely driven by large eddies shed from a nearby headland. Finite-record length observations of tidal currents are shown to be acceptable for estimating device performance, but unsuitable for direct investigation of design loads. },

  abstract  = {Inland coastal waters of the State of Washington, United States, are fjord-like in character and feature passages where tidal currents with speeds of 3 m/s or greater occur. Combined with close proximity to the major metropolitan area of Seattle and easy access to the power grid, the region is a prime candidate within the United States for tidal power generation. A new three-dimensional (3D) model of tidal circulation of these waters has been implemented. The model is based on Stanford University&apos;s SUNTANS code, and covers the eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca, Puget Sound, San Juan and Channel Islands, and the southern Georgia Basin with an unstructured triangular mesh of 250 m average resolution. It is forced with tidal currents from a regional tidal model along open boundaries. Barotropic tidal response is calibrated against compiled tidal data for the region; the system response is characterised in terms of sea surface height variability and energy dissipation. The model can simulate tides with quantitative accuracy within Puget Sound, but it over-predicts tidal range and under-predicts currents in the waterways leading up to the Main Basin of the Sound. Future plans for the model include extension of the model domain for the entire Georgia Basin, incorporation of partial bottom cells and baroclinic processes and improvements in bathymetry.},

  abstract = {AbstractThis article presents the results of a high-resolution (1/12°), two-way nested simulation of the oceanic circulation in the southwestern Atlantic region. A comparison between the model results and extant observations indicates that the nested model has skill in reproducing the best-known aspects of the regional circulation, e.g., the volume transport of the ACC, the latitudinal position of the BMC, the shelf break upwelling of Patagonia, and the Zapiola Anticyclone. Sensitivity experiments indicate that the bottom stress parameterization significantly impacts the mean location of the Brazil/Malvinas Confluence and the transport of the Zapiola Anticyclone. The transport of the Brazil Current strengthens during the austral summer and weakens during the austral winter. These variations are driven by the wind stress curl over the southwestern Atlantic. The variations of the transport of the Malvinas Current are out of phase with those of the Brazil Current. Most of the seasonal variability of this current is concentrated in the offshore portion of the jet, the inshore portion has a weak seasonality that modulates the magnitude of the Patagonian shelf break upwelling. Using passive tracers we show that most of the entrainment of deep waters into the shelf occurs in the southernmost portion of the Patagonian shelf and along the inshore boundary of the Brazil Current. Shelf waters are preferentially detrained near the Brazil/Malvinas Confluence. Consistent with previous studies, our simulation also shows that south of ∼42°S the Malvinas Current is composed of two jets, which merge near 42°S to form a single jet farther north.},

  abstract = {In this modeling study we investigate the dynamical mechanisms controlling the spreading of the Magellan Plume, which is a low-salinity tongue that extends along the Patagonian Shelf. Our results indicate that the overall characteristics of the plume (width, depth, spreading rate, etc.) are primarily influenced by tidal forcing, which manifests through tidal mixing and tidal residual currents. Tidal forcing produces a homogenization of the plume's waters and an offshore displacement of its salinity front. The interaction between tidal and wind-forcing reinforces the downstream and upstream buoyancy transports of the plume. The influence of the Malvinas Current on the Magellan Plume is more dominant north of 50°S, where it increases the along-shelf velocities and generates intrusions of saltier waters from the outer shelf, thus causing a reduction of the downstream buoyancy transport. Our experiments also indicate that the northern limit of the Magellan Plume is set by a high salinity discharge from the San Matias Gulf. Sensitivity experiments show that increments of the wind stress cause a decrease of the downstream buoyancy transport and an increase of the upstream buoyancy transport. Variations of the magnitude of the discharge produce substantial modifications in the downstream penetration of the plume and buoyancy transport. The Magellan discharge generates a northeastward current in the middle shelf, a recirculation gyre south of the inlet and a region of weak currents father north.},

    abstract = { AbstractAs currents flow over rough topography, the pressure difference between the up- and downstream sides results in form drag—a force that opposes the flow. Measuring form drag is valuable because it can be used to estimate the loss of energy from currents as they interact with topography. An array of bottom pressure sensors was used to measure the tidal form drag on a sloping ridge in 200 m of water that forms a 1-km headland at the surface in Puget Sound, Washington. The form drag per unit length of the ridge reached 1 × 104 N m−1 during peak flood tides. The tidally averaged power removed from the tidal currents by form drag was 0.2 W m−2, which is 30 times larger than power losses to friction. Form drag is best parameterized by a linear wave drag law as opposed to a bluff body drag law because the flow is stratified and both internal waves and eddies are generated on the sloping topography. Maximum turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rates of 5 × 10−5 W kg−1 were measured with a microstructure profiler and are estimated to account for 25\%–50\% of energy lost from the tides. This study is among the first to measure form drag directly using bottom pressure sensors. The measurement and analysis techniques presented here are suitable for periodically reversing flows because they require the removal of a time-mean signal. The advantage of this technique is that it delivers a continuous record of form drag and is much less ship intensive compared to previous methods for estimation of the bottom pressure field. }

abstract = {Observations of the gravitational circulation over the sill at the entrance to Puget Sound indicate a fortnightly modulation of the two-layer flow with a corresponding variation in stratification. Gravitational circulation and stratification reach a maximum during neap tides and a minimum during spring tides. The modulation appears to be a function of the turbulence generation by tidal flow over the sill, which varies as a function of tidal amplitude. The enhanced gravitational circulation during neap tides augments the flux of dense water across the sill region and episodes of bottom water renewal in Puget Sound result. Intrusions of dense water in the main basin of the sound show a fortnightly periodicity with a phase lag appropriate for the propagation of an internal bore from the sill region, commencing at the neap tide. Observations indicate that the intrusions take the form of gravity currents, propagating at approximately 20 cm s−1 down the main basin. The detailed dynamics of the turbulent mixing processes that modulate the onset of inflow were not resolved in this study, but the integrated effect of tidal mixing on the low-frequency circulation is clearly demonstrated.}

  abstract = { AbstractThe far-field, barotropic effects of in-stream tidal energy extraction from Puget Sound are quantified using a one-dimensional channel model. In-stream turbines are modelled in regions of energetic flow in northern Admiralty Inlet and Tacoma Narrows. The far-field extraction effects include changes to the tide (amplitude and phase), transport, power dissipation, and kinetic power density. These effects are observed throughout Puget Sound and are dependent on the magnitude and location of extraction. The model indicates that a 5 per cent reduction in transport in the South Sound would correspond to either 260 MW of dissipation by in-stream turbines in Admiralty Inlet, 120 MW in Tacoma Narrows, or an intermediate level of dissipation in both locations. The environmental and economic limits on future developments are discussed. For pilot-scale development, this modelling indicates that the barotropic, far-field extraction effects on Puget Sound will be immeasurably small. },
