  abstract = { Tidal energy resource characteristics are presented from a multi-year field study in northern Admiralty Inlet, Puget Sound, WA (USA). Measurements were conducted as part of a broader effort to characterize the physical and biological environment at this location ahead of a proposed tidal energy project. The resource is conceptually partitioned into deterministic, meteorological, and turbulent components. Metrics with implications for device performance are used to describe spatial variations in the tidal resource. The performance differences between passive and fixed yaw turbines are evaluated at these locations. Results show operationally significant variations in the tidal resource over length scales less than 100 m, likely driven by large eddies shed from a nearby headland. Finite-record length observations of tidal currents are shown to be acceptable for estimating device performance, but unsuitable for direct investigation of design loads. },

  abstract  = {Inland coastal waters of the State of Washington, United States, are fjord-like in character and feature passages where tidal currents with speeds of 3 m/s or greater occur. Combined with close proximity to the major metropolitan area of Seattle and easy access to the power grid, the region is a prime candidate within the United States for tidal power generation. A new three-dimensional (3D) model of tidal circulation of these waters has been implemented. The model is based on Stanford University&apos;s SUNTANS code, and covers the eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca, Puget Sound, San Juan and Channel Islands, and the southern Georgia Basin with an unstructured triangular mesh of 250 m average resolution. It is forced with tidal currents from a regional tidal model along open boundaries. Barotropic tidal response is calibrated against compiled tidal data for the region; the system response is characterised in terms of sea surface height variability and energy dissipation. The model can simulate tides with quantitative accuracy within Puget Sound, but it over-predicts tidal range and under-predicts currents in the waterways leading up to the Main Basin of the Sound. Future plans for the model include extension of the model domain for the entire Georgia Basin, incorporation of partial bottom cells and baroclinic processes and improvements in bathymetry.},

  abstract = {AbstractThis article presents the results of a high-resolution (1/12°), two-way nested simulation of the oceanic circulation in the southwestern Atlantic region. A comparison between the model results and extant observations indicates that the nested model has skill in reproducing the best-known aspects of the regional circulation, e.g., the volume transport of the ACC, the latitudinal position of the BMC, the shelf break upwelling of Patagonia, and the Zapiola Anticyclone. Sensitivity experiments indicate that the bottom stress parameterization significantly impacts the mean location of the Brazil/Malvinas Confluence and the transport of the Zapiola Anticyclone. The transport of the Brazil Current strengthens during the austral summer and weakens during the austral winter. These variations are driven by the wind stress curl over the southwestern Atlantic. The variations of the transport of the Malvinas Current are out of phase with those of the Brazil Current. Most of the seasonal variability of this current is concentrated in the offshore portion of the jet, the inshore portion has a weak seasonality that modulates the magnitude of the Patagonian shelf break upwelling. Using passive tracers we show that most of the entrainment of deep waters into the shelf occurs in the southernmost portion of the Patagonian shelf and along the inshore boundary of the Brazil Current. Shelf waters are preferentially detrained near the Brazil/Malvinas Confluence. Consistent with previous studies, our simulation also shows that south of ∼42°S the Malvinas Current is composed of two jets, which merge near 42°S to form a single jet farther north.},

  abstract = {In this modeling study we investigate the dynamical mechanisms controlling the spreading of the Magellan Plume, which is a low-salinity tongue that extends along the Patagonian Shelf. Our results indicate that the overall characteristics of the plume (width, depth, spreading rate, etc.) are primarily influenced by tidal forcing, which manifests through tidal mixing and tidal residual currents. Tidal forcing produces a homogenization of the plume's waters and an offshore displacement of its salinity front. The interaction between tidal and wind-forcing reinforces the downstream and upstream buoyancy transports of the plume. The influence of the Malvinas Current on the Magellan Plume is more dominant north of 50°S, where it increases the along-shelf velocities and generates intrusions of saltier waters from the outer shelf, thus causing a reduction of the downstream buoyancy transport. Our experiments also indicate that the northern limit of the Magellan Plume is set by a high salinity discharge from the San Matias Gulf. Sensitivity experiments show that increments of the wind stress cause a decrease of the downstream buoyancy transport and an increase of the upstream buoyancy transport. Variations of the magnitude of the discharge produce substantial modifications in the downstream penetration of the plume and buoyancy transport. The Magellan discharge generates a northeastward current in the middle shelf, a recirculation gyre south of the inlet and a region of weak currents father north.},

    abstract = { AbstractAs currents flow over rough topography, the pressure difference between the up- and downstream sides results in form drag—a force that opposes the flow. Measuring form drag is valuable because it can be used to estimate the loss of energy from currents as they interact with topography. An array of bottom pressure sensors was used to measure the tidal form drag on a sloping ridge in 200 m of water that forms a 1-km headland at the surface in Puget Sound, Washington. The form drag per unit length of the ridge reached 1 × 104 N m−1 during peak flood tides. The tidally averaged power removed from the tidal currents by form drag was 0.2 W m−2, which is 30 times larger than power losses to friction. Form drag is best parameterized by a linear wave drag law as opposed to a bluff body drag law because the flow is stratified and both internal waves and eddies are generated on the sloping topography. Maximum turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rates of 5 × 10−5 W kg−1 were measured with a microstructure profiler and are estimated to account for 25\%–50\% of energy lost from the tides. This study is among the first to measure form drag directly using bottom pressure sensors. The measurement and analysis techniques presented here are suitable for periodically reversing flows because they require the removal of a time-mean signal. The advantage of this technique is that it delivers a continuous record of form drag and is much less ship intensive compared to previous methods for estimation of the bottom pressure field. }

abstract = {Observations of the gravitational circulation over the sill at the entrance to Puget Sound indicate a fortnightly modulation of the two-layer flow with a corresponding variation in stratification. Gravitational circulation and stratification reach a maximum during neap tides and a minimum during spring tides. The modulation appears to be a function of the turbulence generation by tidal flow over the sill, which varies as a function of tidal amplitude. The enhanced gravitational circulation during neap tides augments the flux of dense water across the sill region and episodes of bottom water renewal in Puget Sound result. Intrusions of dense water in the main basin of the sound show a fortnightly periodicity with a phase lag appropriate for the propagation of an internal bore from the sill region, commencing at the neap tide. Observations indicate that the intrusions take the form of gravity currents, propagating at approximately 20 cm s−1 down the main basin. The detailed dynamics of the turbulent mixing processes that modulate the onset of inflow were not resolved in this study, but the integrated effect of tidal mixing on the low-frequency circulation is clearly demonstrated.}

In-stream turbines are modelled in regions of energetic flow in northern Admiralty Inlet and Tacoma Narrows. The far-field extraction effects include changes to the tide (amplitude and phase), transport, power dissipation, and kinetic power density. These effects are observed throughout Puget Sound and are dependent on the magnitude and location of extraction. The model indicates that a 5 per cent reduction in transport in the South Sound would correspond to either 260 MW of dissipation by in-stream turbines in Admiralty Inlet, 120 MW in Tacoma Narrows, or an intermediate level of dissipation in both locations. The environmental and economic limits on future developments are discussed. For pilot-scale development, this modelling indicates that the barotropic, far-field extraction effects on Puget Sound will be immeasurably small. },

abstract = "The Chilean Patagonia, on the southeastern Pacific Ocean, is one of the largest fjord systems in the world. Its complex topography harbors an aquaculture industry that is among the top exporters of salmon and mussels worldwide. However, little is known about the scales of environmental variability of this region and how climate-related changes can alter the current conditions. This study provides a baseline understanding of the dominant scales of subtidal variability in meteorological forcing and water properties along and across the region that encompasses northern Patagonia and specifically the Inner Sea of Chiloé (ISC). We examined multiple datasets spanning multiple spatial and temporal scales. Reanalysis wind time series were combined with satellite-derived data (MODIS-Aqua) and in situ hydrographic records from the mussel farming industry as well as from instruments moored at various locations in the ISC. We assessed the influence of large-scale forcing on the variability of local conditions and used the assembled datasets to find modes of variability at interannual, seasonal and intraseasonal scales. The patterns of atmospheric and oceanographic variability along northern Patagonia are heterogeneous both in time and space. Long-term sea surface temperature (SST) averages revealed two areas with colder temperatures and attenuated seasonal variability that can be associated with stronger vertical mixing. These areas have been previously related to hotspots for whale sightings and might be important as bottom-up controls of Patagonian food webs. Northern Patagonia is strongly affected by large-scale processes at the South Pacific basin scale. Long-term wind data show a poleward displacement of the transition between upwelling and downwelling favorable conditions during spring-summer months for the last decade. The intraseasonal time scale was dominated by a band centered at 30 days that can be attributed to atmospheric variability driven by the Baroclinic Annular Mode (BAM), which induces the periodic mixing of the water column, but with substantial interannual variability. Variability in local conditions was found to closely track the large-scale variability, even in the small channels and bays. These findings highlight the strong connection between large-scale processes and the conditions faced by aquaculture in the ISC, and the need to consider such scales of variability - as well as climate trends - in planning and management decisions."

On the Atlantic side, the Strait is characterized by semidiurnal macrotides with mean and spring tide ranges of 7.1 and 9.0 m, respectively. On the Pacific side, tides are mixed, mainly semidiurnal, with mean and spring tide ranges of 1.1 and 1.2 m, respectively. Wide tidal flats and basin geometry tend to amplify the Atlantic shelf tides in the eastern extreme of the Strait. Tidal choking occurs in a series of narrows, causing stepwise decreases in tidal range from east to west. The mean tide range is initially amplified to 8.4 m, then reduced to 4.0 m, and subsequently to 1.2 m within 150 km of the Atlantic Ocean. Peak tidal currents exceed 3 m s−1 in the narrow constrictions and may reach 4.5 m s−1. The tidal form number is 0.12 in the eastern Strait, but exceeds 0.25 less than 125 km from the Atlantic. Bahi´a Gente Grande, an embayment located 165 km into the Strait from the Atlantic, experiences a tidal regime that shifts from semidiurnal to third-diurnal to quarter-diurnal during each month. This regime results from reduction of semidiurnal constituent amplitudes, existence of appreciable diurnal constituent amplitudes, and a four-fold amplification of the M6 amplitude, which in combination give rise to the double water phenomenon."

abstract = "Here, we participated in five independent research cruises that spanned almost the entire Patagonian fjords region (from 41.5 to 56.0°S) in order to determine the importance of the physical/chemical factors that influence phytoplankton size structure triggered by freshwater discharge and oceanic water intrusion. Throughout the Patagonian region phytoplankton biomass varies in association with freshwater discharge and mineral nutrient load, and to a lesser extent with surface solar radiation and photosynthesis. These correlations and the spatial domains changed depending on which size fraction was analyzed. Fresh water discharge negatively correlated with salinity and density, positively correlated with stratification and silicic acid concentration, and represents the primary influence on phytoplankton populations. More than 40\% of the sites characterized as discharge-intensive locations exhibited lower total chlorophyll-a concentrations (chl-a) and phytoplankton size-structure that was dominated by small cells (<20 µm). Oceanic nutrients (nitrate and phosphate input) are the second-most important factor that control total chl-a, favoring total chlorophyll-a concentration in the southern half of the Patagonian region. Microphytoplankton contribute to more than 75\% of the total community in high productivity waters with chl-a concentrations higher than 2 µg L−1 and picophytoplankton dominate when chl-a is lower than 1 µg L−1. Thus, in this extensive area, the relative success of different phytoplankton size classes may be sensitive to changes in hydrological cycles, continental runoffs, and potential anthropogenic eutrophication, modifying important ecological processes and the fate of organic matter."

abstract = "In the Patagonian Andes erosion by temperate Pleistocene glaciers has produced a deeply incised fjord system in which glacial and non-glacial sediments were deposited since the Late Glacial glacier retreat. So far, fjord bathymetry and structures in the sediment infill were widely unexplored. Here we report the results of an investigation of morphology and sediment characteristics of a 250km long fjord transect across the southernmost Andes (53°S), using multibeam and parametric echosounder data, and sediment cores. Subaquatic morphology reveals continuity of on-land tectonic lineaments mapped using field and remote sensing data. Our results indicate that glacial erosion and fjord orientation are strongly controlled by three major strike-slip fault zones. Furthermore, erosion is partly controlled by older and/or reactivated fracture zones as well as by differential resistance of the basement units to denudation. Basement morphology is regionally superimposed by Late Glacial and Holocene subaquatic moraines, which are associated to known glacier advances. The moraines preferentially occur on basement highs, which constrained the glacier flows. This suggests that the extent of glacier advances was also controlled by basement morphology. Subaquatic mass flows, fluid vent sites as well as distinct Late Glacial and Holocene sediment infills have furthermore modified fjord bathymetry. In the western fjord system close to the Strait of Magellan subaquatic terraces occur in 20 to 30m water depth, providing an important tag for proglacial lake level during the Late Glacial."

abstract = "In the Western Strait of Magellan in southernmost Chile marine transgression occurred between 14,500 and 13,500cal.BP. This is indicated by strongly increased accumulation of biogenic carbonate and first appearance of foraminifers in sediment records. From that time until 11,500cal.BP, sedimentation in the western fjords became predominant autochthonous, due to higher salinity and clay flocculation, and Late Glacial glacier retreat. Present day thermohaline zonation pattern, extensively representative for the Holocene, and sedimentation rates indicate that westerlies hampered westward outflow of superficial (0–30m water depth) glacial clay-rich freshwater from glaciated areas. During the Holocene, isostatic uplift of the Andes overcompensated sea level rise. In areas with high Glacial glacier loading this led to shallowing fjord sills and restricted exchange with marine water, especially since high freshwater inflow produced strong pycnoclines and preserved old saline water in fjord bottoms. To the east of the climate divide the Seno Skyring fjord system shows a year-round stable stratification, despite a strong wind-induced eastward superficial current in the upper 30–50m of the water column. Such currents enabled significant Late Glacial eastward transport of glacial clay. Sediment cores from this area indicate that east-ward sediment flux slowed down during the Holocene, probably due to less intense westerlies. Investigated present day thermohaline characteristics of the fjord system across the superhumid climate divide of the Southern Andes indicate details of the exchange between marine and freshwater which are fundamental for evaluation of sediment transport pathways, biogenic productivity and interpretation of paleoclimate records in this area."

abstract = {Abstract This paper presents a detailed palaeoglaciological reconstruction of ice sheet dynamics in the Seno Skyring, Seno Otway and Strait of Magellan region of the former Patagonian Ice Sheet, with a particular focus on previously hypothesised zones of rapid ice flow and the evolution of proglacial lakes. Geomorphological mapping from a combination of satellite imagery and oblique and vertical aerial photographs reveals a variety of glacial landforms that are grouped into several discrete flow-sets and associated ice margin positions. The most distinct features are represented by flow-sets of highly elongate streamlined glacial lineations on both sides of the Strait of Magellan. Based on the shape and dimensions of the flow-sets and their abrupt lateral margins, a transverse and longitudinal variation in glacial lineation length and elongation ratio, and the reported presence of a potentially deformable bed and thrust moraines, the flow-sets are interpreted as zones of rapid ice flow within the Otway and Magellan lobes. We hypothesise that this provides evidence for contemporaneous surge-like advances within the lobes, which may explain the asymmetry in the lobate margin positions on either side of the strait. The mechanisms that initiated rapid flow are unclear, but are likely to have been influenced by internal factors such as a change in thermal/hydrological conditions at the bed. The topography of the region suggests ice-dammed lakes would have formed as the ice lobes retreated. The westernmost of the former lakes, Lake Skyring, is delimited by a series of palaeo-shorelines surrounding the present-day lake Laguna Blanca and we reconstruct lake evolution based on manipulation of a digital elevation model. The size and orientation of meltwater channels and a large outwash plain indicate that Lake Skyring drained eastwards towards the Strait of Magellan, probably quite rapidly. We conclude that the potential for quasi-independent surge-like behaviour within adjacent lobes raises the possibility that, during climate-driven ice expansion, some advances in this region may have been partly controlled by secondary internal feedback mechanisms.

In this context, results from the first fine-scale measurements of bio-oceanographic features in the water column of fjords associated with the Strait of Magellan are presented. A submersible fluorescence probe (FP) was used to measure the Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration in situ, along with conductivity, temperature, hydrostatic pressure (depth) and dissolved oxygen (CTD-O2) of the water column. The Austral spring results of 14 FP-CTD-O2 profiles were used to define the vertical and horizontal patches of the fluorescent pigment distribution and their spatial relations with respect to the observed hydrographic features. Three zones with distinct water structures were defined. In all zones, the ‘brown’ spectral group (diatoms and dinoflagellates) predominated accounting for >80wt\% of the phytoplankton community. Thin layers with high Chl-a concentration were detected in 50\% of the profiles. These layers harbored a substantial amount (30–65wt\%) of the phytoplankton biomass. Stratification was positively correlated to the occurrence of Chl-a thin layers. In stable and highly stratified water columns the integrated Chl-a concentration was higher and frequently located within thin layers whereas well mixed water columns displayed lower values and more homogeneous vertical distribution of Chl-a. These results indicate that mixing/stability processes are important factors accounting to the vertical distribution of Chl-a in Magellan fjords."

This paper presents a new reconstruction of the glacial history of five ice lobes in southernmost South America: the Bahía Inútil − San Sebastián, Magellan, Otway, Skyring and Río Gallegos ice lobes. We use previous geomorphological mapping of glacial landforms to reconstruct former glacial limits and proglacial lakes, demarcate flow-sets from the distribution of glacial lineations, and evaluate glacial landsystem signatures and their palaeoglaciological implications. Evidence suggests that the ice lobes predominantly reflect active temperate glacial landsystems, which may have switched to polythermal systems when periods of cold-based ice developed ephemerally. This complex landsystem signature implies that the ice lobes were sensitive to regional climate variability, with active re-advances during overall retreat of the ice margins. There is also evidence for periods of fast ice flow and possible surge-like activity in the region, followed by the rapid retreat or even collapse of some of the ice lobes in association with proglacial lakes. Constraining our new reconstruction with published chronological information suggests that at least some of the ice lobes advanced before the global Last Glacial Maximum (gLGM: ca. 26.5–19 ka) during the last glacial cycle. Our new reconstruction demonstrates a more complex picture of ice dynamics than has previously been portrayed, and one in which the advance and retreat of the ice lobes was likely to have been primarily driven by changes in climate. As such, ice advances before the gLGM in the southernmost part of the Patagonian Ice Sheet are likely to indicate a wider climatic forcing at this time.},
