    abstract = { Tidal energy resource characteristics are presented from a multi-year field study in northern Admiralty Inlet, Puget Sound, WA (USA). Measurements were conducted as part of a broader effort to characterize the physical and biological environment at this location ahead of a proposed tidal energy project. The resource is conceptually partitioned into deterministic, meteorological, and turbulent components. Metrics with implications for device performance are used to describe spatial variations in the tidal resource. The performance differences between passive and fixed yaw turbines are evaluated at these locations. Results show operationally significant variations in the tidal resource over length scales less than 100 m, likely driven by large eddies shed from a nearby headland. Finite-record length observations of tidal currents are shown to be acceptable for estimating device performance, but unsuitable for direct investigation of design loads. }

   abstract = {Inland coastal waters of the State of Washington, United States, are fjord-like in character and feature passages where tidal currents with speeds of 3 m/s or greater occur. Combined with close proximity to the major metropolitan area of Seattle and easy access to the power grid, the region is a prime candidate within the United States for tidal power generation. A new three-dimensional (3D) model of tidal circulation of these waters has been implemented. The model is based on Stanford University&apos;s SUNTANS code, and covers the eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca, Puget Sound, San Juan and Channel Islands, and the southern Georgia Basin with an unstructured triangular mesh of 250 m average resolution. It is forced with tidal currents from a regional tidal model along open boundaries. Barotropic tidal response is calibrated against compiled tidal data for the region; the system response is characterised in terms of sea surface height variability and energy dissipation. The model can simulate tides with quantitative accuracy within Puget Sound, but it over-predicts tidal range and under-predicts currents in the waterways leading up to the Main Basin of the Sound. Future plans for the model include extension of the model domain for the entire Georgia Basin, incorporation of partial bottom cells and baroclinic processes and improvements in bathymetry.},
